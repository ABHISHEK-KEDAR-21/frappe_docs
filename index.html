<h1>Full Stack Web Framework</h1>


<h2>Build extensions to ERPNext or make your own app</h2>



<p>Frappe is a full stack web application framework written in Python,
Javascript, HTML/CSS with MySQL as the backend. It was built for ERPNext
but is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.</p>

<p>The key differece in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that Frappe
is that meta-data is also treated as data and is used to build front-ends
very easily. Frappe comes with a full blown admin UI called the <strong>Desk</strong>
that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment
and much more out of the box.</p>

<p>Frappe also has a plug-in architecture that can be used to build plugins
to ERPNext.</p>

<p>Frappe Framework was designed to build <a href="https://erpnext.com">ERPNext</a>, open source
ERP for managing small and medium sized businesses.</p>
