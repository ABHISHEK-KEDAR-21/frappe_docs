# Frappé Framework

### Tutorials, API documentation and Model Reference

Frappé is a full stack web application framework written in Python,
Javascript, HTML/CSS with MySQL as the backend. It was built for ERPNext
but is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.

Frappé Framework was designed to build [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com), open source ERP for managing small and medium sized businesses.

### Why Use Frappé

Frappe comes with all the features you will ever need, out of the box:

1. Metadata based modeling
1. Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
1. Rich, scriptable admin UI
1. Templated views using Jinja
1. Users, Roles and Sessions
1. Role and rule base permissions
1. REST API
1. Realtime communication with Node.js + Socket.io
1. Background jobs and scheduler (Python RQ)
1. Email support POP/IMAP/SMTP
1. PDF printing
1. Report Generators
1. Kanban, Gantt and Calendar Views
1. Database migrations
1. Production Configs (configuration setup for NGINX, Redis, Supervisor)
1. Multi-tenancy
1. Extensible architecture with apps and hooks

And much more...

This means that Frappé is an opinionated system and is not designed to be a light-weight framework to make To Do lists.
